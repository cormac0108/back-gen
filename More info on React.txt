
react has webpack underneath the hood so it does the bundling of code for us.  import React from 'react';
react is a view library. react dom can be used to render to DOM sites. react native can be used to render 
to mobile phones.   
i want the reactdom package to use the function render   and it renders whatever is in the parameters . 
destructuring: import {component}    also /app.js    make sure you change your files to javacsript babel. 

component has the rule that it must render something.  creating your own custom components.  one parent that 
has children. if your building a component it should be capitalized e.g Hello 
cra is so aweomse  it shows you exactly what the errors are.   
export default Hello   to export the class / component.   dfault meaning one thing. 
within the render function we tell it what we want to return.   now test your website in the browser (using
live-server)   tada!  we just created our very first react component.  return expects a single thing
you cant give it multiple lines.   the cool tachyons css package.   predefined things   
npm install tachyons
